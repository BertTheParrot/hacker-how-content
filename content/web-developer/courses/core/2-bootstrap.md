#Bootstrap

# Outcome

You'll:

* Be able to get decent default styling on your web pages
* Understand what 'responsive' means and how make your page responsive it.
* Less precise but useful layout techiques
* Be able to build lots of components you can see all over the web
* How to include icons onto your page

# Prerequisites

* [html and css foundations](1-html-and-css-foundations.md)

Bootstrap is a great tool when you're starting out. When you get more advanced you might move away from it (i'm not that advanced yet!).

Embrace the grid for nearly everything you do.

Use it to 'reset' the browser defaults (which are truly awful).

We're going to learn how to customise Bootstrap in a later course, you can modify the default fonts, and colours it uses :smile:

[Bootstrap v4](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/08/19/bootstrap-4-alpha/) is coming quite soon. But we'll use 3 for now.
