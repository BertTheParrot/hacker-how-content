## Advice

You can watch codeschool videos faster than x1 if it helps you.

HTML 5 and CSS 3 are the latest versions. But HTML and CSS are continually improved in modern browsers so the numbers aren't important. Just use the latest / best features.

### HTML

HTML is old and all the browsers have to support it. As a result the tag names e.g. `<div>` make no sense :smile:. You just have to learn them...

### CSS

Opinion: The 'box model' is old and very difficult to reason about. There's a newer model called the flex-box model which is much easier.

Opinion: `float`, `block` and `inline` are hard, and getting something to layout how you want it is surprisingly hard.

The videos talks alot about 'resetting' the css to override the browser defaults. There are tools / libraries to help with this, you wouldn't do it manually.
