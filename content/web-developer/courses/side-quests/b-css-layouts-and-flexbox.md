#CSS layouts and Flexbox(Not ready)

# Outcome

You might understand: How box layouts work. (I still don't)

You will understand: How flexbox layouts work.

## Why

The standard layout in HTML is weird. I still don't 100% understand it. I found even after many hours using standard layout I still sometimes struggled.

Flexbox is a newer way of laying things out that is far more sensible. I found after a couple of hours I could make any layout I wanted 99% of the time :smile:

#Advice

Couldn't find a perfect guide, these guides are pretty good but not perfect.

When something is prefixed with `webkit-` you shouldn't need to do that (that's how they prefix experimental webkit features)

Bare in mind [which browsers flexbox supports](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)
