# Git Cheat Sheet

## Actions

###See which directory you're in

`pwd` (present working directory (stupid huh))

###Move to another directory

`cd directory_name` or cd `directory_name/blah/de/da` (`/` after each directory, this is a unix / linux thing (Mac is based on linux))

###Move up a directory

`..` means 'one directory up'
`.` means 'the directory i'm currently in'

To move up a directory: `cd ..`

###Display the contents of a file

`cat filename`

###Kill a running process

<ctrl + c>
## Tips

### Tab

Tab tries to auto complete stuff for you. I mash it all the time :smile:.

If something tab complete's it's 100% correct, if you type it it's 'probably right' -> Tab wins.
