#Advice

jQuery was a revelation about 7-8 years ago, it's fallen out of favour by serious web devs more recently. But it's still super simple and it's by far the easiest to understand :simple:. You can build pretty much any kind of interactive website you can imagine using it.

jQuery mainly focuses on updating the html on the site dynamically. But it also does a TONNE of other stuff, you should only use it for manipulating HTML and listening to user events (e.g. a click).

IMO where jQuery falls down is the maintainabiilty of the code as you build a large site. It's easy to write buggy code, which is hard to debug. But this is quite subtle, so you might not see any of those cracks whilst you're working with it.
