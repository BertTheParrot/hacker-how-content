#Javascript Foundations

Warning: This course is long. It's 4 code school courses. But once you're done, you'll understand everything you need to know about Javascript :smile:.

# Outcome

You'll:

* Understand the majority of the features of the Javascript language.
* Be ready to learn how to make interactive web pages.

# Prerequisites

* [html and css foundations](1-html-and-css-foundations.md)

# Advice

* Javascript has versions (although Chrome, for example, tends to release them feature by feature all the time). Version ES5 is the current version, but ES6 is a lot better :smile:
* The code school courses are based on ES5.
* He says semi colons are necessary and semi colons are good. They're not necessary anymore in modern javascript.
* These days we don't tend not to use `while` loops or `for` loops. We'll use arrays and a collections library instead (Like `.map`). You'll learn this soon.
* `undefined` and `null` are a pain. There are some libraries which help us do `undefined` and `null` checking later :smile:

* Javascript (Especially ES5) has a lot of things programmers don't like / find hard. ES6 helps alot of these things.
  * Variable scope
  * When you load a .js file `<script src="myScript.js" />` it just runs...
  * All global variables in any of your .js files are accessible globally, so you can access them from anywhere. (Try not to use global vars...)
  * There are ~3 ways to declare a function :(
  * Hoisting is dangerous!
  * Objects in ES5 are quite basic (and have more than one way of doing things... overlap between objects and prototypes)

* We will use arrays. But we won't use the manipulation methods much e.g. `pop`, `push` or `shift`. We'll use collection libraries :smile:
* Some of the stuff they do in the closure section you would never do.
* ES6 offers much better syntax for doing prototypes....
* Take loop performance section with a pinch of salt. Performance is hard. If you code is slow - measure how slow it is and try and speed it up.
* We'll be learning [something](http://browserify.org/) later to help with namespaces.
