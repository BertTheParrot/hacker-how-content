# ES6 / ES2015 & ES7
# Outcome

You'll:

* Understand what ES6 (ES 2015 or ES.next) is.
* Be using ES6 by default in your code.
* Have an appreciation for ES7

# Prerequisites

* Javascript ES5.

# Advice

Javascript has a poor reputation for a programming language. ES6 is a masssive step forward to making things 'proper'. It will make your coding more concise more readible. It will also help you when you come to learn other languages (most of the features are borrowed from elsewhere.)

Browsers don't support ES6 natively ([they do support some features](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)), so we have to transpile ES6 -> ES5 for compatability in older browsers. To do this there is a tool called [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (it's already in all our webpack projects :smile:).

# Learning materials

# Core

* [ES6 Features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#readme)
* [ES7 Features](https://github.com/hemanth/es7-features#readme)

# Tasks

* Take a look at theese ES6 Features we'll be using.
  * let
  * arrows
  * template strings
  * modules
  * destructuring
  * default + rest + spread (For React mainly)
  * classes
  * Object rest properties (ES7) (For React mainly)
  * Object spread properties (ES7) (For React mainly)
* For each feature, build an example of it working and look at the ES5 code that gets generated.
