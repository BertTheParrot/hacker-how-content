#Git and Github

# Outcome

You'll:

* Be able to use the common git commands
* Collaborate with other developers
* Version your code so you can back to any previous point in time.
* Use github and undestanding the PR model for reviewing code.

# Prerequisites

None

#Advice

95% of developers use git for version control. It has ALOT of features, you'll use <50% of them (as do I!).

Git is very command line based, i've not found a UI that works very well. The tool that visually helps me to understand what's going on is Github.

We'll be using the Pull Request model so I can take a look at the code you're writing and review it for you to help you get better :smile:.

# Tasks

* Run through the code school course + tasks.
* Setup git on local machine (you should be using SSH rather than https when you use git (no password prompts))
  * Install git via [Brew](http://brew.sh/)
  * Name
  * Email
  * [Git Radar](https://github.com/michaeldfallen/git-radar), which makes your command line look awesome.
* Create a public git repo, create a readme.md, do a commit to master, put that commit on github, create a branch, do a change to readme.md, submit a pull request on that branch on github which RG will approve :smile:
* Start using it for all other task submissions once you're done :smile:
