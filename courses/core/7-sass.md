#Sass

# Outcome

You'll:

* Have a general understanding of Sass.
* Have a good understanding of:
  * Variables
  * Importing

Other than importing / variables, the other features are a nice to have right now.

# Prerequisites

* HTML and CSS foundations

#Advice

We'll use the extension .scss

Another alternative is LESS, which is very, very similar, but slighty worse IMO.

The whole point is to make CSS less rubbish :). The most common features we'll use are: variables and imports. I personally don't use the advanced features that much.

Bootstrap can be imported purely as Sass, you can then override a massive list of variables to control almost every aspect of how it works (colors, paddings, fonts etc.).

There are bunch of useful Sass things in library [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/). It's too advanced for me :).  But I know some good frontend devs use it :).

###Building Sass

Sass is 'compiled': `.scss` -> `.css` (since `.css` is source code it's technically a 'transpile' (fancy!))

So you write your website in .scss, .html and .js and you 'build' it to .css, .html and .js

We will use a tool called webpack to help do this compilation (and later, other compilations for javascript)

# Learning materials

# Core

* [Code School Assembling Sass](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/assembling-sass) (Level 1 & 2. Skip or Skim the rest.)

## Alternative

# Tasks

* Run through code school + tasks (you can do this quite quickly, variables are important, the rest is nice to know)
