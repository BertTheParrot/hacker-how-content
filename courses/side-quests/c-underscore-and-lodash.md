#Underscore and Lodash(Not ready)

# Outcome

You will understand what underscore and lodash are and why you should use them when you're programming Javascript.

# Advice

Javascript doesn't come alot of core libraries. So you end up writing quite alot of code yourself. Thankfully underscore was invented which provides a tonne of useful functions to help you out.

Underscore is particularly useful for it's operations on collections.

Lodash and Underscore serve the same purpose and are 98% the same as far as I can tell. Lodash is the new hotness, so we'll use that :smile:

Functions which I use often:

* Map
* Find
* Filter
* Where
* FindWhere
* Reject
* Every
* Some
* Contains
* SortBy
* GroupBy
* Compact
* Flatten
* Debounce (useful for UI stuff sometimes)
* Clone
* IsEqual

# Tasks

* Run through the learning materials
* Build an example of 5 of the above function I said I used locally.
* Convert your examples to use lodash and see if they work.
